> A customizable, interactive bash-like shell written in Python

# Description
Developers use shells to complete basic, everyday tasks. This project is a simple shell written in python to provide easy extensibility. Beginner computer science students should be able to read this code and understand how a shell might work.

# Purpose

It is mostly a project to help me, the author, understand how certain shell commands work with each other, and how to parse and handle different numbers and type of arguments in the manner a shell would. This is to prepare me for one of my next projects, a compiler.
<br><br>
Ideally, it can be used to learn more about Python beyond a data analysis / scripting language, and more of a general-purpose language capable of providing developers with necessary functions.
<br><br>
To seriously build a shell, a language like C, C++, or Rust would be ideal. Python's interpreted nature makes it a particularly bad language for a tool that communicates with the operating system like a shell. To reiterate,
this project is mostly for the author to explore Python's features and to keep the author busy coding in Python, to practice its important features while the author works on other projects

# Environment

This project is being developed with Python 3.11

It involves heavy use of the ```os```, ```sys```, and ```subprocess``` libraries, which are all standard Python libraries.

# Commands / Operations currently supported
- pwd
- sysinfo
- Executing external python scripts and executables in the same directory

# Commands / Operations in progress
- cd
- htop
- accepting arguments
- debug mode
- logging
